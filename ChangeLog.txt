0.11.1
  new parameter capture_foreground_window_if_1 (captures the HWND of GetForeGroundWindow at startup time)
  some minro merging with audio
  
0.11.0
  some ui friendlinesses
  possibly an async fix for this and/or the audio portion

0.10.2
  hopefully fix start bug introduced in 0.10.1 
  
0.10.1
  fix UI to make options actually selectable

0.10.0
  add option to not display mouse (capture_mouse_default_1)

0.9.{7,8}
  include a patched mplayer to make p2p streaming drop less [phew!]
  GUI cleanups for p2p streaming
  disable wav for now (buggy)

0.9.6
  more p2p streaming available options
  default to 32-bit instead of 24-bit, in case it is more compatible (though barely slower) with some systems [vlc, too]

0.9.5
  minor ui improvements

0.9.4
  add broadcast streaming from your desktop option.
  bump virtual audio version to 0.4.1 [possibly more win8 friendly]
  
0.9.3
  hopefully work with VLC when the width*bit depth doesn't add up to an even multiple of 4.
  Haven't determined yet if this is VLC's bug or not, but it was causing it to come in like a diagonal blurred image...

0.9.2
  hopefully a working release of 0.9.1

0.9.1

  bump virtual audio version, to default to 16 bit, which is more compatible with FMLE

0.9.0

  add streaming (like to justin.tv) option

0.8.7

  actually work with ffmpeg again on jdk7, also close right

0.8.6

  bump virtual audio and "GUI wrapper" code, which now accomodates dshow devices with spaces in it.

0.8.5

  possibly the same fixes as 0.8.4 (name i420 better at least is here now)...

0.8.4

  some stability fixes when restarting it in the same process.
  comes with a virtual audio that is updated to hopefully allow for 5.1 input
  not use .mov container format for video, as it apparently needed stable incoming frame rates.

0.8.3

 fix virtual audio "too high PTS" bug. I hope.
 add an option to "reveal transparent selection window" before each recording, and/or always reveal files.
 
0.8.1

 default to 24 bits (oops, 16 was faster but worse? Who'd uh thunk.)

0.8.0

 includes 64 bit devices by default, minor gui
 
0.7.0

  default to qtrle for the video codec for all recordings, much more efficient for screen captures, though still not efficient enough somehow...

0.6.8

  add icon for recording with start/stop button

0.6.7

  fix fatal bug of not marking things (oops),
  add parameter for if you want to use CAPTUREBLT and blink your mouse

0.6.6

 audio icon rename, aesthetic, newer better ffmpeg [or was it the same?]

0.6.5

better audio sniffer, hopefully

0.6.4

better installer, "scaling" registry settings are said to work now.
; fix ffplay resize bug, cleanup some dshow code, add debug/benchmarking
0.6.3 5/8/12

bump virtual audio version

0.6.2 4/27/12

fix for i420 color output looking grey :P
add some more parameters for internal "scaling" if you want to have windows do that for you, before passing it off down the pipe.
rename some parameters
speedup! (well, if you don't have aero installed) max 100fps -> 250 fps
fix benchmarker to be slightly more realistic.

default is 16 bit capture now, in an attempt to make it more speedy. Tell me if you don't want/like this though!

0.6.1 4/26/12

add i420 output support for flash media live encoder. Yikes.
"synchronize" the output fps better, for VLC sake.  It still lets you specify an fps that your system
can't actually do, in the which case you'll get messages like:


avcodec warning: almost fed libavcodec with two frames with the same PTS (754903828860)
avcodec warning: almost fed libavcodec with two frames with the same PTS (754903862193)
stream_out_transcode debug: drift is too high, resetting master sync
stream_out_transcode debug: drift is too high, resetting master sync

see http://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=99906


0.6.0 4/24/12

fix mouse if using hwnd, allow for hex input to command line script input utility (also has a window input utility).

Add *tons* more options in the registry, also make it so you can specify a small window if desired, ex: vlc's --dshow-size="100x100" [crops currently, subject to change!]

new registry options:

'disable_aero_for_vista_plus_if_1', 'track_new_x_y_coords_each_frame_if_1', 
    'dedup_if_1', 'millis_to_sleep_between_poll_for_dedupe_changes'

0.5.0 4-10-12

add "optional" hwnd_to_track registry setting.  Currently if the window "goes away" then it will just grab black.
If it doesn't exist at start time, it raises an exception.
"delete" the registry key if you want to clear it.

0.4.0 2-12

fix mouse bug, make it "really" respond to registry changes for window size (window can move)

0.3.9 2-27-12
  make it respond to registry changes for (for now just position, not size...ask me if you want the other)

0.3.8 1-5-12 
  bring audio skipper back to a known release
  minor verbiage tweaks

0.3.7 1-3-12
  allow it to work on multiple monitors.

0.3.6 12-2-11
  bump virtual audio device version
  add ability to restart audio broadcaster

0.3.5 oct 20 11
  remove CAPTUREBLT oops

0.3.4 10-14-11
  make it work with XP again

0.3.3 9-28-11
  make an easy out way when starting audio server

0.3.2 9-27-11
  make it so that recorder can record anything, make it slightly more robust, too.
    too bad it uses so much disk space...
  add mouse
  
0.3.1 9-26-11
  add a hopefully working, hopefully human friendly self-broadcaster...

0.3.0 9-23-11
 allow SetFormat to accept NULL so that it won't crash flash player. Added an interface, too, but it's un-used I doubt.

0.2.5: 9-21-11:
  fix bug so that VLC will accept it for capture (I consider it VLC's bug, but hey, that's just me :P)
    ok so part my bug, part theirs
  minor aesthetics.
  bundle the audio device driver for vista+ participants

0.2.4: 09-19-11:
  attempt to not register as IAMStreamSource
  small speedup by preferring 24 bps as the default over 32

0.2.3: 9-16-11:
  allow to change fps with dialog

0.2.2:
  make it respond more accurately to GetStreamCaps, for enumeration to work (ffmpeg better at least) and it appears to work better with gstreamer as well.
  minor UI tweaks

0.2.1:
  make it easier to re-register on failed etc.

0.2.0: 
  Even better window drawer (now transparent with java 7)
  slightly optimized screen capture (optimized to not use CPU currently, creates huges files though!)
  it still uses too much cpu, but working on it.
  default to 24 fps (hmm)

0.1.1: Better window drawer (kind of)

0.1.0: has a friendlier script for recording screen, another option for setting it up

0.0.4: Include more executables, including the option to record now [!]

0.0.2: better name, report "better" stats to the capture device.

0.0.3: respects fps settings, in its own kludgey way.  Should work though, and not cause any slowdown if you can't keep up anyway :)
