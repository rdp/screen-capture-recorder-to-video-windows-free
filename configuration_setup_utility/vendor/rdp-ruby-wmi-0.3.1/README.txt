== DESCRIPTION:

  ruby-wmi is an ActiveRecord style interface for Microsoft's Windows
  Management Instrumentation provider.

  Many of the methods in WMI::Base are borrowed directly, or with some
  modification from ActiveRecord.
    http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html

  The major tool in this library is the #find method.  For more
  information, see WMI::Base.

  There is also a WMI.sublasses method included for reflection.

== SYNOPSIS:

  # The following code sample kills all processes of a given name
  # (in this case, Notepad), except the oldest.

    require 'ruby-wmi'

    procs = WMI::Win32_Process.find(:all,
                                    :conditions => { :name => 'Notepad.exe' }
                                   )
    morituri = procs.sort_by{|p| p.CreationDate } #those who are about to die
    morituri.shift
    morituri.each{|p| p.terminate }
