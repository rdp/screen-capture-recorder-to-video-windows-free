Contact me about a (free) open source license.
Basically I can release the code under "some license", but it cannot be GPL, or so I'm told.

Since you're just calling into a DLL, it might still be compatible with GPL licensed programs, 
as long as they just call the DLL.
See also Redistribution section in the README.
